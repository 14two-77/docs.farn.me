# IT Audit in Bitka Project

## Overview

- BitKa project is **excellent** for someone targeting an **IT Audit internship**.
Fintech + security + data flows + compliance = very strong resume material.
Below is a complete plan: what they can do, what they need to learn, example deliverables, and sample resume bullets.

---

### 1. Why this project is good for an IT audit intern

An IT audit intern’s job is typically to evaluate:

* **Internal controls** (access, authentication, authorization, change management)
* **Data security** (encryption, key rotation, backups)
* **Process compliance** (KYC, AML, logging, monitoring)
* **System reliability** (incident response, DR, business continuity)
* **Regulatory compliance** (GDPR, ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI-DSS depending on company)

BitKa is a mini-crypto-bank/exchange project → this is exactly the domain where those skills apply.

Even if the product is small or not complete, the intern can still perform **audit documentation, control testing, risk assessment, and compliance mapping**.

---

### 2. What they can do in this project (concrete tasks)

#### **A. Document the System: Data Flow Diagrams + Control Points**

* Identify how user data moves (signup → auth → KYC → wallet → deposit/withdraw).
* Identify key control points: authentication, authorization, rate limits, logging, wallet signing, API roles, service-to-service trust.

**Deliverables:**

* Level 0–2 Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
* Inventory of all personal data fields and storage locations
* Risk assessment for each stage (STRIDE or similar)

---

#### **B. Create an IT General Controls (ITGC) assessment**

Set of internal controls such as:

* RBAC for backend and cloud
* Password policy
* Logging & monitoring
* Backup/restore testing
* Change management (GitHub PR flow)
* Secure deployment (CI/CD)

**Deliverable:**

* ITGC checklist
* Gap analysis (What is missing, what needs improvement)

---

#### **C. Perform Security Configuration Audit**

Examples:

* Review backend services for:

  * JWT config
  * Key rotation
  * Password hashing
  * TLS enforcement
* Review infrastructure:

  * Docker security
  * Traefik HTTPS config
  * Database roles (least privilege)

**Deliverable:** Findings report + remediation recommendations.

---

#### **D. Privacy & Compliance Gap Mapping**

Map the BitKa system against:

* **ISO 27001 Annex A controls**
* **PDPA (Thai data protection law)**
* **GDPR (high-level mapping)**
* **SOC 2 criteria**
  This is GREAT on resume.

**Deliverable:**
“BitKa vs ISO 27001 control matrix”
“BitKa PDPA compliance gap report”

---

#### **E. Audit Logs Review + Improvement Plan**

* Evaluate completeness of logs:

  * authentication attempts
  * KYC status changes
  * deposit/withdraw events
  * admin actions
* Recommend log retention & separation of duties
* Design secure log pipeline (e.g., Loki → S3 backup)

**Deliverable:** Audit logging scope document + recommended schema.

---

#### **F. Risk Assessment of Wallet & Transaction Flows**

Even if trading is not finished:

* Document risks in deposit/withdraw
* Evaluate fraud prevention controls
* Recommend improvements (limits, approval workflow, anomaly detection)

**Deliverable:** Crypto wallet risk assessment document.

### 6. What “compliance” means in job descriptions for IT Audit

Most internship listings include terms like:

#### ✔ ISO 27001

Information security management system — the most common framework companies use.

#### ✔ SOC 2

Auditors check controls for Security, Availability, Confidentiality. (Very common for tech startups.)

#### ✔ GDPR / PDPA

Data protection legislation. PDPA is Thailand’s. GDPR is EU’s.
Key areas: consent, data retention, right to access/erase, data minimization.

#### ✔ PCI-DSS (only if dealing with payments)

If this project expands to fiat payments, mention awareness but not necessary for crypto-only.

#### ✔ ITGC

Access control, change management, backups, operations.

#### ✔ OWASP / cybersecurity best practices

Many listings ask for this.

#### ✔ Risk Assessment frameworks

ISO 31000 or simple impact × likelihood matrix.

## Practical Plan

Here’s a tight, realistic plan and a ready-to-post Thai job listing tailored for a single **IT Audit internship** on the BitKa project. I designed work so a motivated student who has classes **9:00–16:00 during the first two weeks** can still finish useful, résumé-ready work in **3 weeks** (evenings + weekends). I include:

1. **What they must learn (short & prioritized)**
2. **Concrete 3-week plan** with time estimates and weekly deliverables
3. **Measurable tasks / accepted outputs** (what you’ll review)
4. **Sample resume bullets** they can add after finishing

Keep this as the hiring/assignment post — it’s concise and realistic.

---

### 1) What they must learn (priority order — focused, not exhaustive)

These are the minimum skills they should pick up quickly. Learning resources can be short docs, 1–2 videos, and reading your project README.

**Technical / Security basics**

* **Microservice basics** (what service boundaries are: auth, kyc, ledger, deposit, withdraw) — 2–3 hours
* **Authentication fundamentals**: JWT (RS256), OAuth2 password + refresh flow — 3–4 hours
* **Logging & audit trails**: what to log (auth, kyc changes, deposit/withdraw events), retention basics — 2 hours
* **Postgres basics + simple SQL** (selects, basic joins, counts) — 3–4 hours
* **Threat modelling basics (STRIDE)** and **IT general controls (ITGC)** concepts — 3 hours

**Compliance & frameworks (high-level)**

* **ISO 27001 (Annex A overview)** — 2 hours (high-level mapping)
* **PDPA / GDPR (privacy basics)** — 2 hours
* **SOC 2 basics** (Security & Availability focus) — 1.5 hours

**Optional / helpful**

* Basic familiarity with **Kafka**, **Grafana/Prometheus**, **S3/R2** — 1–2 hours each (only if time)

*Total focused study: ~20–25 hours spread across the whole 3 weeks.*

---

### 2) 3-Week plan (realistic schedule given classes 9–16 in Week1–2)

Assumption: Candidate can work **weekday evenings (2–3 hours)** and **weekends (4–6 hours)** in weeks 1–2, and **more time in week 3**. I give estimated hours.

#### Week 0 — Quick onboarding (before starting) — **1–2 hours**

* Read project README & architecture diagrams (C4).
* Access repo & run local services minimal (auth + wallet) OR review recorded demo.

#### Week 1 (evenings + weekend) — **~12–15 hours**

Goal: Learn core concepts & produce the **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** + Data Inventory.

* Study: JWT/OAuth2 basics, microservices map, logging basics, Postgres query primer. (6–8 h)
* Deliverable 1: **System Data Flow Diagram** (level 1) showing where PII flows (auth → kyc → ledger → deposit) + brief text summary (~1 page). (2–3 h)
* Deliverable 2: **Data Inventory Table** listing personal data fields, storage location (which service/schema), retention suggestion. (2–3 h)

#### Week 2 (evenings + weekend) — **~12–15 hours**

Goal: Audit controls for auth, KYC, backup & logging. Create ITGC checklist.

* Study: ISO 27001 Annex A mapping + PDPA basics + STRIDE quick read (3–4 h)
* Task: Inspect code/config (auth-service & k8s/infra README) and verify presence/absence of controls (JWT key management, keystore, HTTPS, backups, DB roles). (3–4 h)
* Deliverable 3: **ITGC checklist (service-focused)** — access controls, key management, logging & retention, backups, change management, deploy pipeline checks. Mark each control: Present / Partial / Missing + remediation note. (3–4 h)
* Deliverable 4: **Quick log review**: sample 10–20 logs (or simulated log entries) and short report: “Which events are logged? Missing audit events?” (2–3 h)

#### Week 3 (more focused, ~25–30 hours)

Goal: Reconciliation & final report + presentation and resume-ready artifacts.

* Task: **Reconciliation test** (small): choose deposits or refresh tokens — run SQL queries to compare ledger vs deposit events (or tokens table vs auth records). Produce discrepancy report and one automation SQL / script for a daily reconciliation check. (8–10 h)
* Task: **Risk assessment** for deposit/withdraw flows: list top 5 risks, likelihood/impact, and mitigations. (4–6 h)
* Deliverable 5: **Final Audit Report (4–6 pages)** combining DFD, ITGC matrix, log gaps, reconciliation results, risk assessment, and prioritized remediation (short roadmap). (6–8 h)
* Final: 30–45 minute demo for the team + handover (slides + 1-page summary for resume). (2–3 h)

---

### 3) Measurable tasks / accepted outputs (what you will review)

Each deliverable should be short and actionable — reviewers should be able to read in 10 minutes.

1. **DFD diagram (PNG or draw.io) + 1-paragraph explanation** — shows data flow and trust boundaries.
2. **Data Inventory spreadsheet (CSV/Google Sheet)** — columns: field, PII? (Y/N), stored in (service/schema), retention suggested, access roles.
3. **ITGC checklist (table)** — control, location, status (Present/Partial/Missing), remediation (one-line).
4. **Log sample report (1 page)** — example logs checked, missing events, recommended log entries (e.g., "auth:login_failed", "kyc:status_changed", "withdraw:approval").
5. **Reconciliation SQL/script** — minimal reproducible query or Python script that compares two tables and outputs mismatch rows.
6. **Risk assessment & prioritized remediation list** — top 5 risks with mitigation & quick wins.
7. **Final Audit Report & 10-slide summary deck** — concise, with “what to fix in 30/60/90 days.”

If they deliver all of the above reasonably, consider it a success.
