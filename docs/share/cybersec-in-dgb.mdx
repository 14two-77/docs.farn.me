# Cybersecurity role in DGB project


## 🧭 Strategic Focus

They should aim to:

> **Lay down the project’s security foundation**, so that when development progresses, security practices are already embedded in architecture, CI/CD, and configuration.

---

## 🧩 Realistic Roles & Tasks (No full app needed)

### 1. **Security Review of Design & Code (Static Stage)**

**Timeframe:** Can start immediately.
**Output:** Threat model and recommendations document.

**Tasks:**

* Review current folder structure and Go modules (auth, db, config, etc.).
* Create a **threat model diagram** — e.g. using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) or markdown — that describes:

  * Data flow between services.
  * Attack surfaces (JWT, DB, MinIO, Traefik, etc.).
  * Possible mitigations (input validation, least privilege, etc.).
* Identify potential issues:

  * JWT misuse (e.g., missing audience/issuer checks).
  * SQL injection spots (GORM queries).
  * Logging sensitive data.

**Resume impact:**

> “Performed threat modeling and code review for early-stage Go microservice architecture; identified and documented security hardening strategies (JWT validation, database access control, and secret handling).”

---

### 2. **Secure Configuration & Secret Management**

**Timeframe:** Can be done while system grows.
**Output:** `.env.example`, security guidelines, and setup scripts.

**Tasks:**

* Audit `.env` structure — remove secrets from commits.
* Write a `SECURITY.md` explaining how to handle secrets in dev and prod.
* Introduce or document secret vault integration (e.g., **Infisical**, **Doppler**, **Vault**, or even a basic `.envrc` strategy).
* Verify Docker/Podman container security best practices:

  * Avoid running as root.
  * Limit network exposure (Traefik rules).

**Resume impact:**

> “Implemented secret management strategy and secure container configuration for Go-based microservices, using least-privilege and separation principles.”

---

### 3. **Automated Security Scanning (CI/CD Integration)**

**Timeframe:** Once basic CI exists.
**Output:** CI pipeline steps + documentation.

**Tasks:**

* Add scanning tools like:

  * `gosec` for Go code.
  * `trivy` for Docker image scanning.
  * `npm audit` or `pnpm audit` for front-end packages.
* Write a small report after running each.
* Optionally configure GitHub Actions or simple shell scripts.

**Resume impact:**

> “Integrated automated security scanning (gosec, trivy) into continuous integration pipeline to ensure static code and dependency safety.”

---

### 4. **Security Awareness Documentation**

**Timeframe:** Any time.
**Output:** Short wiki or markdown doc.

**Tasks:**

* Write `SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md` for the team, including:

  * How to handle credentials.
  * How to review PRs securely.
  * Logging dos and don’ts (avoid PII).
* Help define a **password policy** or **token expiration strategy**.

**Resume impact:**

> “Authored internal security guidelines and implemented consistent secure logging and token lifecycle policies across backend services.”

---

### 5. **Penetration Simulation (Optional, Later Stage)**

**Timeframe:** Once endpoints exist (mock data OK).
**Output:** Vulnerability report.

**Tasks:**

* Use tools like **OWASP ZAP** or **Burp Suite** against local endpoints.
* Simulate bad JWTs, SQLi attempts, or unauthorized access.
* Report findings with severity and fixes.

**Resume impact:**

> “Conducted penetration testing of internal API endpoints, discovering and remediating authentication bypass and data leakage risks.”

## 🗓️ Example Weekly Plan (2 hours/day)

| Week | Focus                                    | Example Outputs                                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Learn OWASP Top 10 + review current code | `THREAT_MODEL.md`, first findings                        |
| 2    | Secret handling + CI scanning setup      | `.env.example`, `SECURITY.md`, `trivy` + `gosec` reports |
| 3    | Improve JWT & DB security; write docs    | “JWT hardening checklist”, secure GORM usage notes       |
| 4    | Optional: run ZAP or test endpoints      | vulnerability summary & improvements doc                 |

## ✅ Summary

Even if the backend is **not finished**, the cybersecurity student can:

* Do **static reviews** and write **security policy docs**.
* Set up **automation and secret management** for when real code runs.
* Produce **real, demonstrable outputs** that recruiters value.
