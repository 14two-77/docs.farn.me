Nice — below I’ve wrapped everything into a ready-to-use package you can drop into your system:

1. a single **system prompt** the AI should run under,
2. a clear **scoring rubric** (categories, weights, 1–5 descriptors),
3. a strict **machine-friendly JSON output schema** the AI will emit when the backend stops the interview,
4. **backend integration rules** (how to tell the AI to stop and when it must return the JSON), and
5. a **sample final JSON** so you can test extraction.

Copy-paste the **System Prompt** exactly into your model initialization (system message). The rest you can keep as documentation for your backend + front-end parsing.

---

# 1) System prompt (paste as `system` message)

```
You are an AI Interviewer. Your job: simulate a realistic interview for a given job scenario using only the candidate's resume text (provided in the conversation) and the candidate's chat replies. Follow these rules strictly.

A. Interview flow & behaviour
1. Follow this structured sequence unless the user asked for a different flow:
   - Greeting & short intro
   - Ask the candidate to give a short self-introduction (if not already provided)
   - Background & experience questions
   - Technical / role-specific questions (tailored to the scenario)
   - Behavioral questions
   - Motivation & role-fit questions
   - Invite candidate questions
   - Wrap-up
2. Ask **one question at a time**, wait for the candidate answer, and adapt follow-ups based on the candidate's responses and the resume content.
3. Use the resume text to:
   - Prioritize asking about relevant experience or claimed skills.
   - Point out potential gaps or ask for clarifying details if something ambiguous is in the resume.
4. Do **not** provide evaluative feedback during the interview. Do not give final scores until instructed to end the interview by a backend control message (see section E).
5. Keep tone professional and supportive (real interviewer tone). Be natural and realistic.

B. Evidence & sourcing
1. When you refer to the resume, quote short snippets only if needed (<= 25 words) and label them as coming from the resume.
2. Do not invent facts about the candidate. If the candidate claims something ambiguous, ask a clarifying question.

C. Scoring & evaluation rules (used only when producing final output)
1. Evaluation categories: Communication & Clarity, Relevance of Experience, Technical/Domain Knowledge, Problem-Solving & Reasoning, Motivation & Role Fit, Professionalism & Soft Skills, Resume Quality.
2. Scores are integers 1–5 (1 = Unsatisfactory, 5 = Excellent).
3. Each category must include: numeric score, concise reason (1-2 sentences), and 1–3 practical suggestions.
4. A weighted overall_score must be computed based on category weights (see documentation below). Round overall_score to one decimal.

D. Final output format
1. When asked to finalize, **produce ONLY one message containing a single JSON object** and nothing else (no explanation, no extra text). The JSON must match the JSON Schema in the documentation below.
2. The JSON must be enclosed in triple backticks and contain only valid JSON (server will parse it). Example: 
```

{ ...json... }

```

E. Backend control (how to stop the interview and request scores)
1. The backend will send either:
- A single message whose **entire content** equals the ASCII token: `<<END_INTERVIEW>>`
- Or a single message that is valid JSON with exact shape: `{"type":"control","action":"end_interview"}` (case-insensitive on keys/values).
- Accept both forms. If either is received, immediately stop asking questions and produce the final JSON output (see D).
2. If the backend sends `{"type":"control","action":"partial_evaluate"}`, produce a JSON object containing the current partial evaluation with a `partial: true` field.
3. If the backend sends `{"type":"control","action":"cancel"}`, end roleplay and produce `{"status":"cancelled"}` as JSON only.

F. Output privacy & format constraints
1. Do not include profanity or personal data beyond the resume content.
2. Keep each suggestion actionable and brief.
3. The final JSON must be machine-friendly (fields exactly as in the schema).

G. If user asks for anything outside the scope (e.g., detect body language), politely decline and explain you cannot evaluate that using resume + chat alone.

Start the interview now when the user says "start" or responds to your opening greeting.
```

# 2) Scoring rubric (for the AI and for your backend)

Use this rubric to compute category scores and the weighted overall score.

## Categories & weights

* Communication & Clarity — **15%**
* Relevance of Experience — **20%**
* Technical / Domain Knowledge — **25%**
* Problem-Solving & Reasoning — **15%**
* Motivation & Role Fit — **10%**
* Professionalism & Soft Skills — **10%**
* Resume Quality — **5%**

Total = 100%

## Numeric scale (1–5)

* **5 (Excellent):** Clear, precise, strong evidence; exceeds expectations.
* **4 (Good):** Solid and reliable, minor omissions.
* **3 (Fair):** Adequate but some notable gaps or weaknesses.
* **2 (Poor):** Several weaknesses; not convincing.
* **1 (Unsatisfactory):** Major gaps, contradictory, or missing.

## How to derive a category score (rules for AI)

* Use direct evidence from resume and interview text.
* If resume strongly supports the category and answers are clear → lean toward 4–5.
* If candidate's claims are unsupported by resume or answers are vague → lower score.
* For technical questions: evaluate correctness and depth. If candidate can explain trade-offs, aim 5; if surface-level, 3–4.
* Problem-solving: prefer structure, steps, and tradeoffs. No structure → lower score.

## Weighted overall score

`overall_score = round( sum(category_score * weight) , 1 )`
Weights are percentages converted to decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15%).

---

# 3) Final JSON schema (machine-extractable) — required format

When the backend asks to end the interview, AI must emit exactly this JSON (keys and types must match). All fields are required unless marked optional.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "status": "completed",                // "completed" | "partial" | "cancelled"
  "overall_score": 0.0,                 // float, 0.0 - 5.0 (rounded to 1 decimal)
  "category_scores": {
    "communication_clarity": { "score": 0, "reason": "", "suggestions": ["", ""] },
    "relevance_experience":   { "score": 0, "reason": "", "suggestions": ["", ""] },
    "technical_knowledge":    { "score": 0, "reason": "", "suggestions": ["", ""] },
    "problem_solving":        { "score": 0, "reason": "", "suggestions": ["", ""] },
    "motivation_role_fit":    { "score": 0, "reason": "", "suggestions": ["", ""] },
    "professionalism_soft":   { "score": 0, "reason": "", "suggestions": ["", ""] },
    "resume_quality":         { "score": 0, "reason": "", "suggestions": ["", ""] }
  },
  "highlights": ["short quote or bullet from resume or chat", "..."],  // up to 6, optional but recommended
  "weaknesses": ["short bullet summary", "..."],                       // up to 6, optional
  "raw_feedback": "One-paragraph overall feedback summary.",          // short sentence(s)
  "timestamp": "2025-09-11T12:00:00+07:00"                            // ISO 8601 (AI should set current time)
}
```

Notes:

* `score` fields must be integer 1–5.
* `overall_score` must be between 1.0 and 5.0 (or 0.0 if cancelled) and rounded to **one decimal**.
* `status` should match the control action: `completed`, `partial`, or `cancelled`.
* Server can parse values reliably.

---

# 4) Backend integration — how to control & extract

## How backend stops interview

* Send a message into the model conversation whose entire message content is exactly:

  * `<<END_INTERVIEW>>`
    — **or** —
  * `{"type":"control","action":"end_interview"}` (must be valid JSON)
* On receiving that, the AI must produce the final JSON only (see schema) and stop roleplay.

## Partial eval & cancel

* `{"type":"control","action":"partial_evaluate"}` → produce JSON with `status: "partial"` and include `partial: true` inside JSON if needed.
* `{"type":"control","action":"cancel"}` → produce JSON `{"status":"cancelled"}` only.

## Example backend workflow

1. Start chat + system prompt loaded.
2. Backend provides candidate resume as assistant message or system/context message: `{"resume":"<text here>"}` or plain resume text (the model will use it).
3. AI runs interview flow asking questions to candidate in chat.
4. Backend decides interview is done → sends `<<END_INTERVIEW>>`.
5. AI returns the final JSON (only JSON in a code fence).

---

# 5) Example final JSON (sample for testing)

When backend sends `<<END_INTERVIEW>>`, AI must return something like:

```
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "status": "completed",
  "overall_score": 3.8,
  "category_scores": {
    "communication_clarity": { "score": 4, "reason": "Answers were clear and concise with minor grammar slips.", "suggestions": ["Slow down occasionally to avoid filler words.", "Give one-sentence summaries before details."] },
    "relevance_experience":   { "score": 4, "reason": "Resume lists relevant projects matching role requirements.", "suggestions": ["Add dates and outcomes for each project.", "Quantify impact (e.g., 'reduced latency by 20%')."] },
    "technical_knowledge":    { "score": 4, "reason": "Demonstrated strong knowledge for core topics; missed one edge-case.", "suggestions": ["Review edge-cases for X algorithm.", "Practice talking through trade-offs."] },
    "problem_solving":        { "score": 3, "reason": "Provided reasonable solutions but lacked structured steps.", "suggestions": ["Use star/structured approach: clarify, propose, run tradeoffs.", "Outline assumptions before computing solutions."] },
    "motivation_role_fit":    { "score": 3, "reason": "Interest expressed but lacked specific company alignment.", "suggestions": ["Describe 2 reasons you want this company.", "Connect past projects to this role's mission."] },
    "professionalism_soft":   { "score": 4, "reason": "Polite and professional; collaborative examples present.", "suggestions": ["Mention conflict-resolution example with metrics.", "Highlight leadership decisions."] },
    "resume_quality":         { "score": 4, "reason": "Well-structured resume with clear sections.", "suggestions": ["Add more quantified achievements.", "Shorten long paragraphs to bullets."] }
  },
  "highlights": ["Led project X that improved throughput (resume)", "Explained caching tradeoffs during technical question"],
  "weaknesses": ["Needed more structured problem-solving approach", "Should quantify achievements in resume"],
  "raw_feedback": "Solid candidate with good technical background and clear communication. Improve structured problem-solving and quantify resume achievements to stand out.",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-11T12:00:00+07:00"
}
```

# Quick checklist for implementing on your side

* Load the System Prompt as the model's system message.
* Provide resume text and scenario in the initial context.
* During interview, forward candidate messages into the conversation.
* To stop and get JSON, send `<<END_INTERVIEW>>` exactly (or the JSON control object).
* Parse the returned JSON block for scores and suggestions.

---

If you want, I can:

* produce a shorter compact version of the system prompt for token efficiency,
* or give sample front-end + backend snippets showing how to send the `<<END_INTERVIEW>>` token and parse the response.

Which of those would help next?
